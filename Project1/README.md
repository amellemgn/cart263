This is my README file for Project 1: Happiness is Sisyphus?


PECKING ORDER is a game in which you play as the vulture who pecks out Prometheusâ€™s liver every day (*may have been an eagle upon supplemental research, who is to tell, really).

Gameplay:
 As this vulture, you have three lovely growing vulture chicks, who require enough energy to make it through their day. So although you may not remember the Olympian orders that have bound you to your current situation, your liver pecking is really more urgently pressed by the nagging caws of your children. 
This feeding mechanic comprises of several interactions:
- Hovering over poor Prometheus sets him off in a off a strong shiver
- Hovering over your children allows you to zoom in pick them out of the line
- Your hungriest child will tremble in anticipation. Once fed, another will surely react similarly. 
Once you have fed your children a few hundred times, your mind begins to drift off and you start to think of...perhaps prohibited topics. Does the bound man not incur a small bit of pathos? You must emphasize because you too are bound, albeit less painfully, but by the chains of Olympus and destiny nonetheless. It would be so easy to disobey... But you have been doing this routine for so long that you reflexively shut yourself off. 
This 'immoral thought' mechanic triggers when the player presses the button onscreen. A randomized thought appears - maybe you are scared, or distracted, or unconfident, but you are not ready to stop pecking yet. 
Repeat ad infinitum. 

Aesthetic + Statement: 
The desired aesthetic of this game can represent a sort of digital interpretation of the myth of Prometheus (and of course, of Sisyphus). The space is cute and signals a web 2.0 environment with little bouncing birds, pixelized images, a chiptune track, a softly changing background animation. But it's also eerie, in the way of myth: bold aggressive primary colours, a hanging man, an increasingly assertive background track and grating cawing to the tune of your liver picking. 
In a way, this aesthetic 'gamifies' this myth by making clear the presence of a reader/player who must interact with the narrative in this tiny bit of story. Indeed, the myth of Sisyphus is one of inevitability, of labor, of repetition. I'd like to think that this little piece calls to mind these aspects, if at least subconsciously, for the player. As players, or users, our actions also repeat infinitely: click to open, click to close, scroll past, scroll past more, click to open, and so forth. The way that our bodies have adjusted to the cocooning rhythm of technology can hopefully be disrupted by PECKING ORDER, which cynically asserts that if there is an alternative to a safe and comforting routine, that we would be too fearful to embrace it.
